            <h2> France </h2>

            <p> My visit to France was probably the best travel experience I have ever had. 
                Paris was beautiful. I loved the Eiffel Tower, and the place is so lively.
                No matter what time it is, the place is crowded, yet the view is still stunning.
                Viewing the city from the top of the Eiffel Tower was also an incredible experience, 
                especially due to the sunset, which made the horizon even more beautiful than it already is.
                <br /> I also visited the Palace of Versailles, which was also a great experience. 
                The palace was very fascinating, especially considering that most of it is made of gold.
                I loved the famous Hall of Mirrors room, and it was certainly my favorite part of the palace.
                The gardens were also very beautiful, and there were so many amazing viewpoints in the gardens. 
                They were also incredibly large, and it was very fun to explore them.

            <h2> Switzerland </h2>

            <p> Switzerland was one of the most unique countries I have visited.
                Switzerland is a beauty of nature, and the country had so many amazing views.
                The water was so clear, it was a very beautiful turquise color. 
                The mountains were also very beautiful, and the view from the top of the mountains was stunning.
                I went to the top of the Jungfrau mountains, and that place had a lot of fun activities.
                Overall, Switzerland was a very beautiful country, and I would love to visit it again.

            <h2> Italy </h2>

            <p> Italy was also a very beautiful country. It also had a lot of different places to visit.
                First, I visited Venice. Venice was a very unique city, with the primary transportation being boats.
                I even got the chance to ride a gondola, which was a very fun experience.
                I also visited the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and it was very cool. 
                As cool as it seems in pictures, it is even cooler in person.
                However, Rome was my favorite part of Italy. Like Paris, the city was very lively, and there were so many things to do.
                I visited the Colosseum, and it was very interesting. I found the history of the Colosseum to be very fascinating.
                I also visited the Vatican City, and the Vatican Church was very beautiful.
                Italy was such a great place to visit, but the food was even better.
                Yes, the rumor holds true. Italian food is amazing. The pasta and pizza were incredible on their own levels. 
                Overall, the food was amazing, and so was Italy, and I would love to visit it again.
