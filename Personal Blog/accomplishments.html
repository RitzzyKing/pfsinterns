                <h2> Tennis </h2>
                <p> My first tennis tournament victory is always something that I will remember. 
                    I have always struggled getting the last victory of the tournament, and the final game was going very close.
                    It was 4-4, and I was serving. I won that service game to get to 5-4, and then I won the last break point up 40-30 to win the game and the tournament.
                    This was the first of my two tournament wins, and it was a very memorable experience.

                <h2> Speech </h2>
                <p> My first speech tournament victory was also very memorable.
                    I had to prepare a creative story and present it to the judges.
                    Despite my nerves, I was able to present it very well. 
                    The judges were exhilirated by my presentation, and I won the tournament afterwards.

                <h2> DECA </h2>
                <p> I have also been a two-time DECA District Champion. 
                    My first victory was during my freshman year and my first time competing, and I was very surprised by the result.
                    Most recently, in my junior year of high school, I also won at districts, feeling a lot more confident than the last two years.
                    Both experiences were very memorable, and I am excited to compete at state this year.
