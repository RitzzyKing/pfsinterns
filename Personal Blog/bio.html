                    Hey everyone! My name is Rithvik, and I am a high school junior with a deep passion for computer science and technology. 
                    I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and develop new skills in the field. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing video games, spending time with friends, and watching movies or TV shows. 
                    Through this blog, I look forward to sharing my journey, experiences, and insights as I explore the ever-evolving world of technology.

        <h2 class="bio-center"> Music </h2>
        <p class="bio-center">
            Music has been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. 
            I have experience playing multiple instruments, including the piano, guitar, and trumpet. 
            My musical journey began at the age of five when I started learning the piano, which helped me discover my passion for music. 
            Over the years, I expanded my skills by picking up the guitar and later the trumpet during middle school.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-center">
            In addition to instrumental music, I have been a dedicated Carnatic vocalist for over a decade. 
            I have performed in numerous concerts and competitions, earning recognition and several awards for my performances.
            Music continues to be a significant part of my life, and I deeply appreciate its ability to inspire, connect, and express emotions.

        <h2 class="bio-center"> Sports </h2>
        <p class="bio-center">
            I have always enjoyed staying active and playing sports. 
            Some of my favorite sports include basketball, soccer, tennis, and cricket. 
            I used to compete in tennis tournaments and achieved considerable success in the sport. 
            While I no longer compete at a high level, I still love playing sports recreationally with friends.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-center"> 
            Beyond playing, I am an avid sports fan and enjoy keeping up with the latest sports news, matches, and player updates. 
            Whether it's watching a thrilling game or discussing strategies and team performances, sports remain an exciting and important part of my life.
